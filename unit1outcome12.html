      <h1>Unit 1: Outcome 1</h1> 
        <h2>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills? </h2>
        
        <p>
            Working as a freelance digital artist and as a student at Code Nation, 
        
            there are a few different methods I use to complete a project successfully. 
        
            Even when I completed social sciences research I would apply these same effective project management principles to my work…
            
            
                    <h4>Careful project planning </h4>
                    If you have planned a project well it leaves very little to go wrong. In planning a project well, 
                
                    you probably would take into account all the things that could go wrong in the project, 
                
                    then create scenarios of what would you do if that were to happen.
            
            
                   <h4>Time management</h4>
                    What if you have time constraints on your project? Then how can you plan out all the scenarios of what could go wrong? 
                    
                    In these moments you need to prioritise time and resources, keep in mind the people who you could ask for help and most importantly google. 
                    
                    Also if you are stuck on a task, is there something else you could do 
                
                    in the meantime in a project that could be done whilst you solve the answer to the other problem? Working efficiently is key.
            
            
                    <h4>Make sure you have the right tools</h4>
                    Before you start a project make sure to have the correct tools under your belt to begin. 
                
                    In my case, I had to ensure I had node.js installed on my Mac and Visual Studio Code to run and test JavaScript. 
                
                    This made it really easy for me to hit the ground running in the first few days of the course and to try completing some code myself in the meantime. 
                
                    Also, for code-specific projects, making sure your code is de-bugged and running and has been tested with HTML before 
                
                    launching and sending this to a tutor / client or anyone else who will access it. 
            
            
                    <h4>Using Kanban Methodology</h4>
                    Using to do, doing and done statements in my work always enabled me to proceed and allocate my time responsively and to the most urgent tasks. 
                
                    Keeping tasks in order means things get done at the time when they need to be done, which in the end is much more time efficient, 
                
                    especially when working in a team. It means other people aren’t waiting on you if you have your workload complete and sent to them they can proceed.
            
            
                    <h4>Keeping files organised and systems up-to-date</h4>
                    A must do for digital projects. If you have messy files you have a disorganised working method. 
                
                    Make sure digital files for each software are kept in the same place, recent projects kept somewhere easily accessible 
                
                    and that paths to these projects are correct. Avoid moving files around during the project and make sure everything is in the right place 
                
                    before you start coding or designing. It saves time!
            
            
                    <h4>Good communication</h4>
                    Communication is key, in all relationships! Not just with your relationships outside of work but inside of it too. 
                
                    Thankfully digital platforms make communication really easy inside the working environment, with Slack being one of the best communication tools out there.
                 
                    Although being a member of a digital team implies you like spending time on computers this doesn’t make any excuses to be anti-social. 
                
                    Connecting with others who are working in similar areas will strengthen a community and help share knowledge between members. 
                
                    Giving someone a quick call to check how they are doing can make all the difference.
