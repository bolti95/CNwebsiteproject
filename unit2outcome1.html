        <h1>Unit 2: Outcome 1</h1>
        <p>
          <h2>1.1 Describe the content and layout for each page</h2>
          I decided to go for a really simple layout to start with.
           I wanted all my text to be perfectly aligned inside the text boxes in the middle of the page for each page. 
           I also wanted my layout to respond to the size of a screen, so for items to be pushed vertically if the screen
           was shrunk so as not to change the size of the items and make them small. This was a preference for me so that the 
           font size would remain larger and easier to read. The type of website I enjoy using is one that is clear and easy to navigate.
            Sometimes some features of a website make it so difficult to go through the content, who wants that? Not me. I tried to make
             my website accessible to use so a clear navigation bar that stays in the same place across the whole website for each page.

My “about me” section I obviously wanted to make the most eye catching of all my pages. This is why I included the cats,
 I found three images with no background to use for my skills section. At first I tried to make some cat images and edit 
 the background out of these but it took too much time so I had to find some on a <a href="http://freepngimages.com/"target="_blank">free images website</a>. I also wanted 
 to include a bit more personal content to show more of my personality and skills set so I included a link to my Instagram. 

I included some animated text backgrounds and images as an additionally fun feature for the website.
 I didn’t want to over complicate things for myself because of the time constraints on this project but I did want 
 to make room for a little extra coding besides what we had learnt in the lessons. I have a passion for motion graphs so 
 I thought some simple animations would be appropriate. 

Throughout the website I have referenced any of my sources that I used and linked these to my references page,
 even in I am only referring to a website. I would like other people to easily be able to find the things that
  have inspired me and to give credit to the authors. 

        </p>
        <h2>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites </h2>
        <p>
            If you're using any sorts of images, text or logos that you found on the internet, this could
            
            easily run you into copyrighting issues. This isn't something you necessarily have to apply for either.
            
            If you wrote an original piece of text, or a song, or made a piece of artwork that was original, all
            
            you need to do is put your signature on there and a © to prevent people potentially selling,
            
            distributing, performing or placing the work on the internet (that's why you don't film a movie at the cinema!!)
            
            More information about copyright <a href="https://www.gov.uk/copyright"target="_blank">here</a> also referenced <a href="references.html"target="_blank">[4.1]</a>.
            
            So, what's the difference between permissions and copyright? 
            
            You may not need to get permission to use someone's work for a few reasons.
            
            Perhaps it's for non-commercial research, private study or to use in something that won't make
            
            any financial gains. In a digital sense, be sure to reference your links and any information
            
            you've found online that you are paraphrasing, or quoting from. The same for images - put the source link
            
            and you may even want to ask the person who posted the picture in the first place if it's okay for you to use  it
            
            on your own webpage. Be considerate with other people's content. 
        </p>

        <h2>1.6 Access issues that need taking into account - how will people with a disability access the webiste? </h2>
        <p>
           A considerate, experienced and knowledgable web developer will have accessibility of a website in mind when designing.
           
           w3 has outlined some simple accessibility standards to keep in mind when designing a website. <a href="references.html"target="_blank">[4.2]</a>
           
           There are three main things to keep in mind... 
           
           <ul>
               <li>"Web content"- this means any files, such as video/images or text, you choose to insert into your website</li>
               <li>"User agents"- what the website can be accessed on, e.g. is it tablet / mobile accessible? Can it be connected
                   
                   to plugins or apps?
               </li>
               <li>"Authorising tools"- what are the softwares that people make the website on? </li>
            </ul>
               
               
               It's not a bad idea to consider including alternatives to text. Visual or audio elements make a website 
               
               clearer and consider people who may respond to visual or audible stimuli rather than purely text. 
               
               This article may not be the best example, but think about how this website is colour coded. Some text
               
               falls against brighter backgrounds to make this easier for the user to find and uses larger text.  
        </p>
  

   
        <h2>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h2>
        <p>
           There are a range of different file types that can be used in a website to make it more interesting.
           
           For example, images, mp3, video...
         
			
What makes a website really interesting is the use of files

arranged in an interesting layout for users to interact with. 

You could embed other content on your webpage.

For example, in another website I made, I embedded a

Twitch stream on my website so it has a live video stream

On the homepage.  <a href="https://vamcollab.com/"target="_blank">Example</a> <a href="references.html"target="_blank">[4.3]</a>.

The reason I embedded the Twitch link was to save myself memory rather than put a large

video file onto my website. Some files such as videos take up a lot of memory so consider uploading to Youtube and embedding instead.

It’s a really good idea to keep all your files saved in a folder outside your website, offline.

This is incase any files become unavailable online, or are removed by another user.
