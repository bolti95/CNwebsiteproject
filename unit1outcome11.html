         <h2>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h2>
     
         <p>
              
 
             The purpose of digital technology and IT in modern business is undeniably for practical digital functions, to connect users, albeit customers or employees of a business, across all sectors. 
             
             Whether it is to market a product, hold an online shop, or host your portfolio on a website… Even to present an online art gallery. At the time of writing, in Covid-19 lockdown in the UK and across the world, 
             
             the purpose of IT in modern business is highlighted even further. 
         </p>
 
         <p>
             Ultimately, IT tools are vital for dispersing data between people. For example, mobile telephones, Internet browsers, act as platforms for complex data ecosystems that prompt participation from users 
             <a href="references.html"target="_blank">[1.1]</a>.
         </P>    
             Technology is recognised as globally important for economic and sustainable development, as outlined in the report “Road to Dignity by 2030” by the UN<a href="references.html"target="_blank">[1.2]</a>. One of the six elements 
             for delivering sustainable development is “prosperity” - strength of an economy should be “inclusive and transformative” <a href="references.html"target="_blank">[1.3]</a>. As well as innovative, fair access to data systems and technology to 
             increase security and prosperity should be an option for all businesses.
         <p>
              The UN report demonstrates how innovation can increase transparency in networks, in response to the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) a wave of research and calls for global poverty to end, 
              pushed for new technology to tackle this stifling problem of unequal resources <a href="references.html"target="_blank">[1.4]</a>.
              It is therefore not surprising that IT has been proven to have a positive effect on economic growth - one of the key driving forces of IT industry is R&D and innovation <a href="references.html"target="_blank">[1.5]</a>.

             Sophisticated data storing and analytics have allowed for a “data revolution” <a href="references.html"target="_blank">[1.6]</a> which has enabled clearer forecasting for the private and public sectors. As evident over the past 30 years, microprocessors grew quicker, decreased in size yet gained much more power simultaneously.  
            
             For example, since the first hard disk drive, released by IBM in 1956, the amount of storage on there was only 5 mb, equivalent to a mere MP3 song-
            
             at a whopping cost of $1,000 per megabyte- today machines we use are capable of storing over 5TB of data... Quite a remarkable transformation in that amount of time! <a href="references.html"target="_blank">[1.7]</a>
             
             As the curve of technological advancements inclines, what is guaranteed is slick performance within businesses, smart and data-driven decisions, a well-connected and constantly learning digital society <a href="references.html"target="_blank">[1.8]</a>
