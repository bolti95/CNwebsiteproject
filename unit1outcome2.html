<h1>Unit 1: Outcome 2 (Review) </h1>  

<p>
<h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?</h2>


When I made this website, I felt it was easier with a Trello board open to refer back to my progress as I went along. 
Visual Studio Code helped me to organise my approach in building the website, I kept my CSS files next to my HTML files for the same page, 
I worked from the top of the page to the bottom to keep my code organised. 
Visual Studio Code helped fill in some of the blanks of the code I was new to at the start,
 with it’s auto-complete feature. It’s proven to be a really robust text editor which I will use to 
 organise future coding projects. When I made a text-based game in JavaScript,
  I used node.js with the terminal in Visual Studio Code to run and test my code before 
  launching this to my webpage. This was useful for me to identify any errors. Also, it 
  identified errors with underlined code showing errors and the reason for these errors. 
  I also used w3 schools to find some of the code I needed for my design features such as my navigation bar and my animations. 
  If Visual Studio Code was not available, there are plenty of other text editors I could use, or I could test using Code Pen, 
  which is a great resource for a lot of coding-related things including a place to look for developer jobs. 
</p>

<p>
<h2>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h2>

Similarly for my answer in question 2.2, I feel these tools were completely appropriate for my website project. 
They fulfilled the purpose of the tasks I needed to carry out without disrupting my workflow.
 They seamlessly complemented my working method, reviewing, checking what I had left to do, then completing the tasks. 
 One thing that hindered my workflow a lot was only working with one monitor screen, in future I would like to invest with a second monitor,
  in order to keep my to do list up next to Visual Studio Code, to tick things off as I went along with my project. 

<p>
<h2>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? 
  Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change? </h2>

Considering this is the first website I have built from scratch, 
I am pretty happy with the results! Flexbox styling and using containers for my website
 items allowed me to achieve the styling that I wanted. I am pleased with my navigation bar that 
 I built, with the drop-down feature and a page for each of my lengthy answers in Unit 1 giving my 
 text space which makes it much more presentable for the viewer. Before these sections were split up the 
 website didn’t look very good! If I had more time I would have changed the scroll bar, maybe embedded some more 
 features such as music, also discover some new ways to layout my text. At the start I tried to embed my Instagram
  feed into my homepage with Juicer, but this didn’t look very good and it had adverts and I couldn’t figure 
  out how to only show one post. I would like to learn more about embedding social media feeds into websites
   without adverts from other companies, so learn how to embed this myself. 

</p>
<p>   
<h2>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h2>

As I mentioned in 2.3, I am keen to develop integration with social media channels, 
embed more media onto my website and improve some design features such as scroll bars.
 I would like to animate more features in my website, learning how to move images from left to right, 
 as well as fade in and out. 
</p>
<p>
I would definitely spend some more time on the graphics of the website.
 I would like to make my own unique website background using After Effects.
  I would also like to take more time to learn about how websites translate to mobile view 
  from screen view. My website would look for professional and have a sleeker design, perhaps 
  something that would be seen on a graphic design portfolio of someone such as <a href= "https://nvoid.com/">nVoid.</a> 
  I would have more interactive features on my interface, such as original shaders, 
  voice responsive accessibility 
and sound effects for hover-over items (such as a click noise). 
</p>

<h2>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose Unit 1 </h2>

I feel my website matches the project brief. I have made a fully-functioning webpage which is styled with CSS. 
I used HTML to input my website content; the text, images, titles, links that were all required to make my website functional. 
It meets the requirements as I have included all my references, made a list on these and clearly indicated which text I have used 
references for. 
All the questions are answered sufficiently in length, clearly labeled and put into sections with headings.
