            Kanban is the most simple and effective ways to plan something. 
            
            Breaking tasks into to do, doing and done. 
            
            
            It’s roughly translated from Japanese 看板 
            
            as billboard, or visual card/ sign  <a href="references.html"target="_blank">[1.17]</a>,
            
             used and refined by Toyota in their production lines in the 1950s <a href="references.html"target="_blank">[1.18]</a>. 
             
             This way of planning is a solid framework that is commonly used to carry out complex software development tasks, 
             
             by breaking tasks down into smaller more manageable chunks. 
             
             The visual layout of Trello is really helpful when completing a large project with many elements,
              
             such as a game or creating a website. It’s helped me especially at my review stage to ensure the work has been reviewed. 
             
             
             <a href="https://github.com/"target="_blank">Github</a> is a software development community and a place to store and display your IT portfolio. 
             
             
             You can create a repository of your projects, use it to discover new tech projects and you could even set up an organisation workspace on Github to host team projects. 
             
             It’s an ideal place to share your code and other projects for feedback and testing from other experienced tech users.
             The respository feature is amazing - you can edit code communally and learn new code for particular projects.
             Someone can report bugs or recommend changes to the project if needed. 
             
             I often use it as a place to find new TouchDesigner projects and look at the mechanics of these.
