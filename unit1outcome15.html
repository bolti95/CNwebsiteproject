      <h1>Unit 1: Outcome 1</h1> 
        <h2>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job? 
        </h2>
        <p>
            This thoroughly depends on what you’re making. 
            It doesn’t matter if you’re working from home or in the office but think about if you need something portable for a project,
             
            would you really choose a bulky PC over a sleek laptop? 
            
            Although if you need a lot of processing power for a task maybe a PC is worth the investment.
            
            

            Research is the backbone for selecting the right digital tools for the job at hand. 
            
            I am making notes constantly wherever I am, with my phone on notes, jotting ideas down in a notebook even.
            
             If I read something about certain software and what it can do it may come useful for a project so I’ll jot this on my phone.
              
             I try to position myself in a work space when I am researching though, at a desk, or sat down somewhere with my laptop. 
             
             
            
             In the past I have had to make a technology matrix which contains all the available technology that there is to complete a project, 
             
             it’s geographical availability, it’s cost and functions.
             
             <h3> Here's an example</h3>
            
        </div>
        
            <div class="imageCenter">
                <!-- <img src="exampleMatrix.png" style="width:100%"> -->
                <div class="image-container">
                  
                </div>
            </div>
          
            
            <!-- <img scr= "exampleMatrix.png" class="exampleMatrix" alt="example"></div> -->
            <!-- <img scr class ="exampleMatrix"> -->
       
        
       
        <!-- <img src class="exampleMatrix"> -->
        
        <div class= "unit11Text2">

             
             A good way to start this for a website is make a list of all the tasks you need the website to fulfil, 
             
             list these down the side of your matrix, then take your research from that point. 
             
             If you have time this can really help to target the right software for the job, depending on the size of the job.
            
            
            Especially in a graphics environment, certain software will run a task which others will not be able to,
             
            so it’s especially important to know what softwares are out there that could complete a job successfully. 
            
            Although, making sure you fully understand what you need to do could be more important than the technology itself. 
            
            Say for example you are using a basic version of WordPress to build your website and you want to create a nice slideshow feature. 
            
            Do you need to pay for premium for this feature? 
            
            Not if you know how to properly use the internet and find the correct CSS, HTML and JavaScript to implement this feature. 
            
            Being resourceful can help you get the most out of the technology or services you are already using. 
            
            
            Some systems hold a company together, for example, CRS systems...
            
            a company might have a pre-existing website they need you to update, 
            
            so knowing what technology a company uses is important and doing some research about 
            
            this before starting a job can put you in a comfortable position. 
            
            
            Being cost effective goes a long way in business and working for yourself. 
            
            If you can figure out how to make a website at the lowest cost this can save you 
            
            in the long-run and allow you to allocate financial resources in other areas of a project.
