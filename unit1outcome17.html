        <h2>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects? </h2>
        <p>
            GDPR stands for the General Data Protection Regulation and is a highly regulated and strict privacy and security law <a href="references.html"target="_blank">[1.19]</a>. 
            
            This law applies for European citizens and anyone who is managing, storing or accessing the data of European citizens, 
            
            so this applies to anyone globally who is interacting with the data of a European citizen. 
            
            In the UK, the Data Protection Act 2018 was implemented to apply similar “data protection principles” <a href="references.html"target="_blank">[1.20]</a>.
            
             The government enforced law states that all citizens have the responsibility to use personal data carefully and abiding to the law. 
             
             There is a detailed <a href="https://www.gov.uk/data-protection"target="_blank">list</a> <a href="references.html"target="_blank">[1.20]</a>on Gov UK. </p>
             
             
<p>
The more sensitive the data, the higher the level of security should be. For example, identity data, financial data… 

Data that’s used for equal opportunities and biometric data is particularly sensitive and personal data.

 There are also specific data guidelines for data related to criminal convictions etc. 
 
 If you are making a website that requests personal data from someone, say in an application form, 
 
 you need to make sure the data abides by the law and is being handled securely and that you are keeping people’s data updated,
  
 or, if they wish not to update the data, be sure to delete it once it’s no longer needed. 
 
 You should also ensure this data is never shared with any unnecessary third parties <a href="references.html"target="_blank">[1.21]</a>.

As a user of the internet and digital devices, as a citizen living in the UK, 

you are entitled under the Data Protection Act 2018 to request from the government and any other organisations for your data. 

Noone can deny you of this. Access to your data is a human right!
 
For example, did you know that you can request to Google that they share all the data they have stored on you and ask them to delete this ...
(instructions can be found <a href="https://helpdeskgeek.com/how-to/how-to-download-your-personal-data-from-google/"target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3024190?hl=en"target="_blank">here</a>
<a href="references.html"target="_blank">[1.22]</a>)

It’s important to update your policy in an IT department according to GDPR laws and any new laws that come into place,

 otherwise, you could be in for a heavy fine! 
 
 This massively impacts digital projects and the way you work within a digital project especially when handling anyone else’s data. 
 
 Make sure your systems are protected and encrypted so no data is stored anywhere that is public and ask website users how they wish their data to be used
 
  (e.g., do you want to sign up to the mailing list? If yes, can we save your email? If not then do not save the email or personal information). 
  
  In applying to jobs you give away a lot of information. 
  
  It’s perfectly acceptable to ask the company to delete this information 
  
  if you do not wish for it to be stored after your application (unless you go on to get a job with them, they may still need to use your data!).
