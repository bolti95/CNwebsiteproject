  <h1>Unit 1: Outcome 3 (Review)</h1>
  <h2>Develop and test solutions to improve ongoing use of IT tools and systems </h2>
  
  <p>
  <h2>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – 
    could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? 
    Could you have done it in teams? </h2>
  
  The drawbacks of some IT tools include some hindering functions, for example, 
  I found auto-complete on Visual Studio Code hindered my work at times. It also comes down to time limitations.
  It would auto-complete the wrong tags in my HTML or I would type in the rest of the code and it would duplicate this by accident. 
  This made my workflow less efficient and meant I would have to take time to delete things. 
  I feel I would potentially turn this feature off in future projects. 
  However, perhaps this is a feature I just have to get used to and learn to avoid typing things out twice.
   I think using Live Server will make my workflow more efficient in future, as I did not use it for this project, 
   but would mean less time refreshing my work.
  
  </p>
  <p>
  It takes time to learn different tools and technologies, for example, learning new languages such as GLSL. This is a notoriously
  difficult language to learn so to implement these complex features would take a long time to get to a  high level. Draw backs of 
  technology is that it is constantly changing so much, so it leaves you vulnerable as a developer, your code may not be 
  up-to-date. This is why it's important to work in a team and share the most recent coding resources you can find
  between yourselves, even on forums, making sure to search for the most recent materials. 
  I also found that the order in which I completed certain tasks could have improved my efficiency. 
  Perhaps I would complete my navigation bar last next time, as I kept having to rename and rrearrange
  my navigation bar as I developed and added in all my sections.
  
  </p>
  <p>Working in a team would have been good to split some of the work equally between people. 
    Sharing tasks equally would be a time-efficient way to make a website. 
    Ensuring that the team were all connecting on Slack or Google Hangouts would be essential 
    for the website to be pulled together in a team. 
    Communicating on which parts need finishing, who is working on what 
    (so not to “double bubble”) and to figure out who needs to send work to who. 
  </p>
  <p>
  <h2>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency </h2>
  
  I think as I become a more expereinced developer, I will find more uniform ways of working with code,
  and become more organised when I am structuring code projects. I found my code became quite messy at certain
  points of the project so I had to keep going back and re-ordering sections.
  As I referred to in 3.1, I definitely would have benefitted from using Live Server. 
  Also I mentioned earlier that I would invest in another monitor to spread my workload out. 
  I realise that the work is quite physically demanding on my back and hands, so posture and comfort are really 
  important for this job. I would be able to work better in a more comfortable chair and desk that compliments
   my best sitting position. Also I would say how I structure my time could make a big difference
    on my productivity. I think that taking frequent, short breaks would help me to concentrate on my work for 
    longer periods of time. Putting the time in outside of the course would also improve my speed and efficiency in working.
    Making time to complete short courses and excercises at the weekend or in the evenings drastically increased my coding speed. 
    One excercise I have enjoyed using is the <a her="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>, a coding advent calendar
    that requires you to complete complex mathematics to progress further with the challenges.

  <h2>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – 
    what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? </h2>
  
  If I had to work on a website in a team in future, 
  I would make sure that we’re all on Slack together, 
  with a team channel and a Trello board with labels for each team member 
  to view who is working on which tasks. As I mentioned above I may structure 
  my time differently and figure out a working pattern that allows me to be the
   most productive. Setting up a home-work space or a studio office space that is 
   free of distractions would be ideal for me. I think working in a team in a shared
    space would be a positive thing, to bounce ideas off of team members,
     to share any concerns that you really can’t figure out alone. Also, 
     to keep up a good pace with people working around you so you can all
      work towards a common goal at a progressive level. Learning from other 
      people is essential as people can offer a lot of advice about how to 
      achieve productivity from their own experience, as a software developer,
       manager, in any areas of work. 
  </p>
  <p>
  <h2>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions </h2>
  
  What I did to test my website was firstly using HTML in a web browser
   to display my work, then refreshing this to display any changes, constantly 
   referring to this method as I worked. This was in order to identify if anything 
   wasn’t working, then I would know exactly where in the code my mistake would be, 
   if I had misspelt something perhaps. In other scenarios, such as making a game
   with JavaScript, I would run my code through the terminal, share my 
   code with my team members also working on the game, and. Work together
    to identify any syntax errors. 
    Any bugs that occur with technology will lead to a hinderance or to programmes slowing down. Being able to identify these
  quickly will save time in the long-run.
