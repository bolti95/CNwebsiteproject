      <h1>Unit 1: Outcome 1</h1> 
        <h2>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail?</h2> 
        <p>
            Often failure in a digital project may fall upon the technology itself not working, or human errors,
             
            both of these issues arising can equally cause disruption in a project. 
            
            
             Working on digital projects is usually working with data and digital devices. 
             
             Have you checked the device is working? 
             
             For example, if I am working on a project with live visuals, I might be using multiple video card devices, OSC, 
             
             different camera devices that may be live streaming video into my Mac then out through multiple LED screens. 
             
             If something fails to work it could be at any stage of the chain of devices. 
             
             Knowing what signs to look for when a device fails is crucial to quickly fixing an issue in a live environment. 
             
             However, any failures can be avoided by rigorously testing devices and visual patches before a live show. 
            
            
            The same applied really for websites. Before you make a website live, have you checked everything is working properly, 
            
            all the code checked and reviewed across multiple machines? 
            
            Reviewing code with a team can help to identify any issues before launching a website. 
            
            Remember it may not be the technology at fault but a simple human error that could be fixed upon review from another user. 
            
            

            What if you’re working alone? Well ask your friends or family if they can test the HTML file on their PC or Mac before you send it to a client
             
            or launch the project. Reach out to a tech community and get connected with other web developers. 
            
            For example, <a href="https://github.com/"target="_blank">Github</a> <a href="references"target="_blank">[1.9]</a>
            <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/"target="_blank">StackOverflow</a> <a href="references"target="_blank">[1.10]</a>or 
            <a href = "https://www.webdeveloper.com/"target="_blank">Webdeveloper</a><a href="references"target="_blank">[1.11]</a>.
            
            
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are working on a project as a team, what can often cause a project to fail is lack of communication, 
            
            or direction among a team, which could lead to the wrong tasks being completed or misunderstandings between members of the team. 
            
            If you are all sharing a communal todo list, then everyone should be working from the same list, for example on Trello, so everyone can stay on the same page. 
            
            
            From my experience a workplace usually has a cloud that is secure and will contain all the company’s folders and work 
            
            that is being added by different teams within the business. Storing to clouds is an efficient way to keep data together and secure. 
            
            The same can be done for users outside of company workplaces. GoogleDrive is a cloud storage system… So is iCloud… 
            
            there are many options out there to keep data stored besides USB sticks. 
            
            If this is how you store your data make sure to back it up in multiple places, so say if you have internet failure, 
            
            at least you have the work on a USB stick so you can keep going with the work while the internet is down. 

          </p>
          <p>
            
            Cybersecurity using digital software is a huge concern for all users. As a webdeveloper, with a lot of information open to the public,
            
             a business or individual will want to make sure this platform is secure and protected against hacks or any viruses. 
             
             If not this leaves data at risk of being corrupted or financial risk. 
             
             Even bigger threats could arise such as stealing identity, loss of incoming web traffic. 
             
             Not having a secure website or computer can lead to a complete loss of project data and ultimately failure of a project.
              
             There are easy ways to set-up security for a website that are worthwhile putting in place…
             
             
             <ul>
            <li>You could install SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificate. This will encrypt your information - including login details, 
                
                and information passed through your site and it’s users. There are 3 FREE ways to do this. The instructions on how to do this are laid
                 
                out <a href = "https://www.websitebuilderexpert.com/building-websites/how-to-secure-a-website/"target="_blank">in this article</a> <a href="references.html"target="_blank">[1.12]</a>.
            <li>You can install a TSL for free from <a href = "https://letsencrypt.org/getting-started/"target="_blank">here</a> <a href="references.html"target="_blank">[1.13]</a> which will enable HTTPS on a website
                
                 and forms a Certificate Authority (CA) for a web domain.
                 
            <li>You could use anti-malware software. PC mag UK offers a decent analysis and checklist of particular Malware removal
                 
                products and their features  - McAfee <a href= "references.html"target="_blank">[1.14]</a> is a common trusted choice for PC
            <li>Make unique and complex passwords, include as much variation as possible and make your passwords different for each site.
                
                If you store them somewhere digitally make sure that place is safe, too!
            </li>      
            <li>Kee information updated</li>
            <li>Don't fall for hack tricks and scams! Know what to look out for, for example, recognised email address, secure web links (https)</li>
            <li>If your site has any comment sections make sure these are moderated before approving and posting.</li>
            <li>Always run checks and have files backed up somewhere besides the website. </li>
            </ul>
            This list was complied from an online article<a href= "references.html"target="_blank">[1.15]</a> and personally interpreted and added upon. 

            Who has access to our personal data, where is it going? Who could use it? 
            
            These are all concerns each and every one of us has. Password protecting and encrypting data is a way to keep your data guarded.
            
             Encryption is the process of taking data into a coded format, so that if someone tries to access that data, 
             
             they will only be able to with a secret key (this used to be named a “decryption key”) or a password which is required for 
             
             anyone who wants to access the data. This type of data is referred to by the name “chipertext”. 
             
             Otherwise data that is unencrypted is known as “plaintext”<a href= "references.html"target="_blank">[1.16]</a>

            In summary - always protect and backup data stored on a website, or in fact any digital data, time consuming project.
