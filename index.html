            <p>
            Here I am sharing some of the trials and errors of learning to make a website,
          
             what I’ve learnt from completing this myself, using HTML, CSS and
             
             I’ll lightly touch upon JavaScript and GitHub.
             
             At the time of writing, I am completing a course at <a href="https://wearecodenation.com/"target="_blank">Code Nation</a>
              <a href="references.html"target="_blank">[0.0]</a>.
            
             where we’ve worked with JavaScript, HTML and CSS. As part of our final project we had
             to answer a few questions about IT in business and the process of making websites. I have added
             the answers to these questions in the pages Unit 1 and Unit 2. All the references I understandto answer
             these questions are included in my references page.
             </p>
        
        
             <p>
                My name is Izzy Bolt, I graduated from The University of Manchester in 2017 with a bachelor’s degree in Social Anthropology. 
              
                Since graduating I have worked in environmental business, as a support worker for disabled children and as a freelance artist. 
              
                It’s fair to say my life experience is varied! 
              
                My interest in coding comes from a cross-over between my work in 
                <a href="https://derivative.ca/"target="_blank">TouchDesigner</a> <a href="references.html"target="_blank">[0.1]</a>, using this software to create digital projects,
               
                such as VJ projects, and interactive digital art projects.
              
                Take a look at some of my graphics work on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/boltizzy/"target="_blank">Instagram</a><a href="references.html"target="_blank">[0.2]</a>.
               
                Exploring this software, I was introduced to Python, writing expressions in TouchDesigner to execute commands to effect my visual projects. 
              
                Within TouchDesigner, I downloaded GLSL examples (written in a language similar to C, take a look at some examples of 
              
                rendered graphics that were made using <a href="http://glslsandbox.com/e#63830.0"target="_blank">GLSL</a><a href="references.html"target="_blank">[0.3]</a>, 
              
                gained an interest in shaders <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/"target="_blank"> <a href="references.html"target="_blank">[0.4]</a>. Take a look at some cool examples</a>! I began to decode these and understand how these are written. 
              
                Upon completing the code nation course, I decided to make a reflective chart on.....
